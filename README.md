# Lobbster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Code-for-Miami/lobbster.svg?branch=setup_travis_ci)](https://travis-ci.org/Code-for-Miami/lobbster)

Lobbster is an open-source project to help lobbyists comply with reporting requirements for the City of Coral Gables.

## Background
### Lobbyist Responsibilities
Section 2-243 of the _Code of the City of Coral Gables_ creates requirements for non-exempt lobbyists to submit five types of documentation, four of which are submitted as forms to the City Clerk.

* *Annual Registration Application*
  * This application is principal-specific; each year, the lobbyist must submit a separate copy of the application for each principal that they represent.
  * A $250 annual fee is collected with the application unless the lobbyist has already paid the fee for the year or the application qualifies for a fee exemption.
* *Issue Application*
  * This application is also principal-specific; each year, the lobbyist must submit a separate copy of the application for each of their principals, to list all of the issues that they represent for that principal.
  * Because this application is principal-specific, duplicate issues represented across multiple principals will need to be reported multiple times (one time per principal).
* *Lobbyist Expenditure Report*
  * These reports are specific to particular (principal, issue) pairs; a lobbyist must submit one report for each principle/issue combination that they represented.
  * On October 1st of each year, lobbyists who were registered for the prior year must submit expenditure reports for the prior year, regardless of whether or not any expenses were actually incurred.
* *Notice of Withdrawal of Lobbyist Registration*
  * Whenever a lobbyist withdraws as lobbyist for a principal, they must file a withdrawal notice.
* *Amendments*
  * Amendments to these forms must be submitted whenever a change occurs to the information that has been filed. Whether the ammendments have a required format is unclear.

Most of the forms require that the lobbyist sign a statement agreeing to some terms, or swearing under oath that the information on the form is correct.

### City Clerk Responsibilities
* Approve lobbyist registration and issue applications.
* Verify the identities of the people who submit applications and expenditure reports.
* Collect lobbyist fees---and presumably, return fees that are paid by mistake.
* Maintain the records that are submitted.
* Prepare and publish reports on lobbying activity.

## Requirements

(This list is still in-progress.)

* Allow online lobbyist registration.
* Usernames should be email addresses.
* Confirmation step for lobbyists to assent that the information they submit is true.
* Allow lobbyists to register for their principals.
  * Collect the $150 fee.
  * Not-for-profit lobbyists will click on “Wave Fee.”
  * Registration is valid until December 31st in the year of registration.
  * Registration will be pending until City staff confirm ‘Not for Profit’ status.
* Allow lobbyists to submit a withdrawal form at any time to notify the City they are no longer representing a Principal.
* Allow Lobbyist to register each Issue.
  * Unlike registering a principal, this does not require a fee.
* Allow Lobbyist to submit an Expenditure report online.
* Email capabilities to send reminders, receipts and  welcome messages to active Lobbyists.
* Reporting capabilities (Report by Lobbyist, Principal , Issue, Year of Registration, etc.)
