# Lobbster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Code-for-Miami/lobbster.svg?branch=setup_travis_ci)](https://travis-ci.org/Code-for-Miami/lobbster)

Lobbster is an open-source project to help lobbyists comply with reporting requirements for the City of Coral Gables.

## Background
### Lobbyist Responsibilities
Section 2-243 of the _Code of the City of Coral Gables_ creates requirements for non-exempt lobbyists to submit five types of documentation, four of which are submitted as forms to the City Clerk.

* *Annual Registration Application*
  * Each year, a separate copy of this application must be submitted for each principal that the lobbyist represents.
  * A $250 annual fee is collected with the application if 1) the lobbyist hasn't already paid the fee for the year that the application applies to and 2) the registration application doesn't qualify for any fee exemptions.
* *Issue Application*
  * Each year, for each principal that the lobbyist represents, a copy of this application must be submitted submitted to list all of the issues that the lobbyist is representing for that principal.
  * Because this application is principal-specific, duplicate issues represented across multiple principals will need to be reported multiple times (one time per principal).
* *Lobbyist Expenditure Report*
  * On October 1st of each year, lobbyists who were registered for the prior year must submit expenditure reports for the prior year, regardless of whether or not any expenses were actually incurred.
  * These reports are specific to particular (principal, issue) pairs; a lobbyist must submit one report for each principle/issue combination that they represented.
* *Notice of Withdrawal of Lobbyist Registration*
  * Whenever a lobbyist withdraws as lobbyist for a principal, they must file a withdrawal notice.
* *Amendments*
  * Amendments to these forms must be submitted whenever a change occurs to the information that has been filed. Whether the ammendments have a required format is unclear.

### City Clerk Responsibilities
* Approve lobbyist registration and issue applications.
* Maintain the records that are submitted.
* Verify that fees are paid.
* Presumably, return fees that are paid by mistake.
* Prepare and publish reports on lobbying activity.

## Requirements

(This list is still in-progress.)

* Allow online lobbyist registration.
* Usernames should be email addresses.
* Confirmation step for lobbyists to assent that the information they submit is true.
* Allow lobbyists to register for their principals.
  * Collect the $150 fee.
  * Not-for-profit lobbyists will click on “Wave Fee.”
  * Registration is valid until December 31st in the year of registration.
  * Registration will be pending until City staff confirm ‘Not for Profit’ status.
* Allow lobbyists to submit a withdrawal form at any time to notify the City they are no longer representing a Principal.
* Allow Lobbyist to register each Issue.
  * Unlike registering a principal, this does not require a fee.
* Allow Lobbyist to submit an Expenditure report online.
* Email capabilities to send reminders, receipts and  welcome messages to active Lobbyists.
* Reporting capabilities (Report by Lobbyist, Principal , Issue, Year of Registration, etc.)
